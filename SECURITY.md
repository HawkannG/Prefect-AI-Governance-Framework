## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Preferred:** Use GitHub's private security advisory feature:
- Go to: https://github.com/HawkannG/Prefect-AI-Governance-Framework/security/advisories/new
- Click "New draft security advisory"
- Provide details using the template below

**Alternative:** Email security concerns to the maintainer (check README for contact)

### What to Include

Please provide:
- **Description:** Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce:** Minimal test case demonstrating the issue
- **Impact:** What an attacker could achieve
- **Affected versions:** Which versions are vulnerable
- **Suggested fix:** If you have one (optional but helpful)
- **Credit:** How you'd like to be credited (if fix is accepted)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response:** Within 48 hours
- **Triage and severity assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix development and testing:** 2-4 weeks depending on severity
- **Public disclosure:** After fix is released and users have time to update (typically 2 weeks post-release)

## Security Fixes in Version 6.0

The following critical vulnerabilities were identified and fixed in version 6.0:

### V1: Symlink Attack (CVSS 8.4) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Hooks didn't resolve symlinks, allowing bypass of file protection via symbolic links pointing to protected files.

**Fix:** Added `realpath` resolution before all path checks in `prefect-guard.sh`:
```bash
if [ -L "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
  REAL_PATH=$(realpath "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$REAL_PATH" ]; then
    FILE_PATH="$REAL_PATH"
  fi
fi
```

### V2: Path Traversal Bypass (CVSS 7.9) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Regex-based `..` detection could be bypassed with URL encoding, Unicode, or canonicalization tricks.

**Fix:** Replaced regex with canonical path validation:
```bash
CANONICAL_PATH=$(realpath -m "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
# Verify path is inside PROJECT_DIR
case "$CANONICAL_PATH" in
  "$CANONICAL_PROJECT"*) ;;
  *) exit 1 ;;
esac
```

### V3: Command Injection (CVSS 8.1) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Bash-guard hook protected governance files but used pattern matching that could potentially be bypassed.

**Fix:** Enhanced pattern detection and removed unsafe grep fallback.

### V4: Exit Code Misuse (CVSS 6.8) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Hooks used `exit 2` for blocks instead of `exit 1`, preventing Claude Code from properly handling blocked operations.

**Fix:** Changed all blocks to `exit 1`, reserved `exit 2` for actual errors:
- `exit 0` = allow operation
- `exit 1` = block operation (governance violation)
- `exit 2` = error (jq missing, invalid input, etc.)

### V5: jq Fallback Unsafe (CVSS 5.9) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Hooks had grep fallback when jq unavailable, which could be exploited with malformed JSON.

**Fix:** Made jq required, removed grep fallback:
```bash
if ! command -v jq &>/dev/null; then
  echo "🛑 PREFECT ERROR: jq is required for hook operation" >&2
  exit 2
fi
```

### V6: Git Command Injection (CVSS 7.2) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** `prefect-audit.sh` passed unsanitized `PROJECT_DIR` to `git -C`, allowing command injection.

**Fix:** Sanitized PROJECT_DIR with realpath before git commands:
```bash
SAFE_DIR=$(realpath -m "$PROJECT_DIR" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$SAFE_DIR" ] && [ -d "$SAFE_DIR" ]; then
  git -C "$SAFE_DIR" log ...
fi
```

### V7: Hook Directory Tampering - PROTECTED ✅
**Issue:** Need to ensure hooks protect themselves from modification.

**Status:** Already protected - hooks block all writes to `.claude/hooks/` directory.

### V8: Missing Error Handling (CVSS 5.1) - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Hooks lacked `set -euo pipefail`, allowing silent failures.

**Fix:** Added to all 5 hooks:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined var, pipe failure
```

### V9: Log Injection (CVSS 4.2) - MITIGATED ✅
**Issue:** Filenames with newlines could break audit log format.

**Mitigation:** `set -euo pipefail` prevents partial writes. Log format is resilient to special characters.

## Security Testing

Version 6.0 includes comprehensive security testing:

- **400+ security tests** covering all vulnerability types
- **Automated regression tests** for all 9 vulnerabilities
- **CI/CD integration** with GitHub Actions (ShellCheck, CodeQL)
- **Exit code validation** ensuring correct behavior
- **Edge case testing** for encoded paths, symlinks, command injection

Run tests locally:
```bash
bash tests/run-tests.sh
```

## Security Considerations for Users

### Hook Execution Environment

Prefect hooks execute with the same permissions as Claude Code. This means:

✅ **Good:** Hooks can block Claude from violating governance rules
⚠️ **Important:** Hooks run in the user's shell environment with user permissions
🔒 **Best Practice:** Use `lockdown.sh` to make governance files read-only

### Attack Surface

Prefect hooks are **defensive tools** that reduce attack surface:
- They **block** operations, they don't execute arbitrary code
- They **validate** inputs using safe methods (realpath, pattern matching)
- They **log** actions for auditability
- They **fail closed** (block on errors rather than allow)

### Least Privilege

Run Claude Code with minimal necessary permissions:
- **Don't run as root** - hooks don't need elevated privileges
- **Use project-specific directories** - keep governance files in project scope
- **Review hook logs** - check `.claude/audit.log` periodically

### Secure Defaults

Prefect's default configuration is secure:
- All governance files protected (CLAUDE.md, PREFECT-POLICY.md, hooks, settings.json)
- Forbidden directory names blocked (temp, tmp, misc, old, backup)
- Root directory locked down (only allowed files permitted)
- Directory depth limited (max 5 levels)
- Exit codes correct (blocks use exit 1, not exit 2)

## Security Audits

Prefect v6.0 underwent comprehensive security review:
- **Panelist 2 Security Assessment:** Identified 9 vulnerabilities (all fixed)
- **400+ test cases:** Validating security fixes
- **Static analysis:** ShellCheck integration
- **Threat modeling:** Attack vectors documented and mitigated

Full security assessment available in `PanelOutput/panelist-2-assessment.md`.
